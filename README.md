# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bruno Talanski, I'm a software developer from Brazil and currently living in Canada.

My first contact with code was when I created my first website during the golden age of GeoCities using Microsoft Frontpage. Besides coding, gaming and other nerdy stuff were my favorite activities growing up (and still are to this date).

Iâ€™m constantly looking after improving my skills and challenging myself to learn something new.  I'm very passionate about new tech and all things releated.

### Work 

:man_technologist: I'm currently working as a software developer at [Lixar IT](https://lixar.com/), building cool stuff using Node.js, React, Docker and other amazing tools.
