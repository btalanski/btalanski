# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Brazil currently based off of Canada.

My first contact with code was when I created my first website during the golden age of GeoCities using Microsoft Frontpage. Besides coding, gaming and other nerdy stuff were my favorite activities growing up (and still are to this date).

Iâ€™m constantly looking after improving my skills and challenging myself to learn something new.  I'm very passionate about tech and all things related.

Here you will find many of my unfinished projects and my huge collection of starred repos which I intend to try out one day.
